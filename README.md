### Hi there, I'm Xing  ðŸ˜•

## Here are that I did to complete this project:
- Create a local JSON data file
    /Users/xin/makeSchool/int2_1/QuizApp/QuizApp
- Design UI using xcode storyboard
    - Table View
    - UITableViewCell
- Added new UIViewController as pop up showing the user if they answer question correctly or not
    - Implemented modalViewController to modify pop ups
- Added StateManager to store and retreive values using UserDefaults
